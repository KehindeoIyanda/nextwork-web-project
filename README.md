# Java Web App Deployment with AWS CI/CD

## Introduction

This project demonstrates the process of setting up a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for a Java-based web application using **AWS** services. The objective is to automate the process of building, testing, and deploying the Java web app using **AWS CodePipeline**, **AWS CodeBuild**, **AWS CodeDeploy**, **AWS EC2**, and other AWS services.

With this setup, developers can seamlessly integrate their Java web app with GitHub, build and deploy the application to an EC2 instance automatically, and take advantage of modern CI/CD practices to ensure faster, more reliable software delivery.

### Benefits of This Setup:
- **Automation**: Automatically builds, tests, and deploys your Java web app.
- **Scalability**: Elastic scaling via **AWS EC2** and **AWS CodeDeploy**.
- **Security**: Secure management of code, artifacts, and EC2 instances with **AWS IAM** and **Key Pairs**.
- **Modern Development Workflow**: Seamless integration with **GitHub**, **VS Code**, and other tools.

## Technologies

This deployment pipeline uses the following AWS services and tools:

- **Amazon EC2**: Virtual servers used to host the Java web application.
- **Amazon EC2 Key Pairs**: Secure SSH access to EC2 instances for manual configurations and deployments.
- **VS Code**: The code editor used for development and integration with GitHub.
- **GitHub**: Source code repository that triggers the CI/CD pipeline.
- **AWS CodeArtifact**: A managed artifact repository for storing Java dependencies, enabling smooth Maven or Gradle builds.
- **AWS CodeBuild**: A fully managed build service for compiling, testing, and packaging the Java web app.
- **AWS CodeDeploy**: Service for automating deployment of applications to EC2 instances.
- **AWS CodePipeline**: Orchestrates the entire CI/CD pipeline from code commit to deployment.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

1. **AWS Account**: Active AWS account with appropriate permissions.
2. **IAM Roles**: Ensure IAM roles have appropriate permissions for **CodeBuild**, **CodeDeploy**, **CodePipeline**, **EC2**, and **S3**.
3. **GitHub Account**: A repository for storing your Java source code.
4. **VS Code**: For editing and committing code to your GitHub repository.
5. **Maven**: For building the Java web application and handling dependencies.
6. **SSH Key Pair**: For EC2 access.

### Step 1: Set Up Amazon EC2

1. Navigate to **EC2** in the AWS Console.
2. Launch a new EC2 instance with the **Amazon Linux 2** AMI (or any other suitable AMI).
3. Ensure to configure the instance's **Security Group** to allow SSH access (port 22) and HTTP (port 80) if you're hosting a web application.
4. Create an **EC2 Key Pair**. Download the key pair for SSH access to the instance.
5. Install Java and other necessary packages on the EC2 instance after accessing it with SSH.
   Example:
   ```bash
   sudo yum update -y
   sudo yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk -y
   ```

### Step 2: Set Up GitHub Repository

1. Create a **GitHub repository** for your Java web application.
2. Push your local Java web app code to this GitHub repository. If you're starting from scratch, ensure your project is a **Maven** or **Gradle** project.
3. Add your **AWS CodePipeline** as a webhook to trigger on commits to this GitHub repository.

### Step 3: Set Up AWS CodeArtifact

1. Navigate to **AWS CodeArtifact** in the AWS Console.
2. Create a new **CodeArtifact repository** where the Java web app dependencies (Maven or Gradle) will be stored.
3. Configure your `settings.xml` file for Maven or Gradle to access the CodeArtifact repository for dependencies.
4. Update your projectâ€™s `pom.xml` or `build.gradle` to reference this repository.

### Step 4: Set Up AWS CodeBuild

1. Navigate to **AWS CodeBuild** in the AWS Console.
2. Create a new **build project**:
   - Choose your **GitHub** repository as the source.
   - In the **buildspec.yml** file (which should be in the root of your repository), configure the build process for the Java web app. Example `buildspec.yml`:

     ```yaml
     version: 0.2
     phases:
       install:
         runtime-versions:
           java: openjdk8
         commands:
           - echo Installing dependencies...
           - mvn install
       build:
         commands:
           - echo Building the Java Web App...
           - mvn package
       post_build:
         commands:
           - echo Build complete!
           - echo Creating application version...
           - aws s3 cp target/*.jar s3://<your-s3-bucket>/<your-app-version>.jar
     artifacts:
       files:
         - target/*.jar
     ```
3. Set up the build environment, including linking **AWS CodeBuild** to **AWS CodeArtifact** to pull dependencies.

### Step 5: Set Up AWS CodeDeploy

1. Navigate to **AWS CodeDeploy** in the AWS Console.
2. Create a **deployment application** and **deployment group**:
   - For EC2 deployment, configure your EC2 instance to use the **CodeDeploy Agent** for seamless deployments.
   - If using EC2 instances with an **Auto Scaling Group**, ensure your group is configured to handle deployment updates.

### Step 6: Set Up AWS CodePipeline

1. Navigate to **AWS CodePipeline** in the AWS Console.
2. Create a **new pipeline** and configure the following stages:
   - **Source Stage**: Link to your **GitHub** repository to trigger the pipeline on code commits.
   - **Build Stage**: Link to **AWS CodeBuild** for compiling and building the Java application.
   - **Deploy Stage**: Use **AWS CodeDeploy** to deploy the Java application to your **EC2 instance**.

### Step 7: Test the Pipeline

1. Commit a change to your **GitHub** repository to trigger the pipeline.
2. Monitor the progress of the pipeline in the **AWS CodePipeline** console.
3. After the build completes successfully, **AWS CodeDeploy** will automatically deploy the latest build to your EC2 instance.

### Step 8: Configure Continuous Delivery

To ensure that your deployment is always up-to-date:
- Set up notifications using **AWS CloudWatch** for deployment success or failure.
- Monitor EC2 instances via **AWS CloudWatch Logs** to track application health and logs.

## Conclusion

This setup provides a powerful, automated **CI/CD pipeline** for deploying a Java web application on **AWS EC2**. By integrating **AWS CodeBuild**, **AWS CodeDeploy**, **AWS CodePipeline**, and **AWS CodeArtifact**, you can automate the entire process of building, testing, and deploying your application, ensuring high availability, reliability, and faster time-to-market.

With the integration of **GitHub** and **VS Code**, developers can easily push changes, which will be automatically built and deployed with minimal manual intervention.
